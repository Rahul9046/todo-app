## Todo App

A simple todo app that lets user to perform the following tasks:
* Login and view existing todos
* Sign up, incase the user is not registered
* Create a new todo item
* Delete a todo item once its is done

Both creation and deletion of todo items will update the user's data in the database. So if the user logs in the next time, he/she can see the updated items.

### To start the project run the following commands: 
* `mongo` - to start the mongodb database
* `npm start`- to start app
* checkout to the `src/`  folder then run `node server.js` command to start the express server.

That's it. Your app is now running.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
